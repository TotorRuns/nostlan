### What's a "game launcher"?

Nostlan isn't just a fancy file browser for your game files, it brings the console gaming experience to your computer!

Nostlan is [unlike any other game launcher](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/wiki/How-is-Nostlan-different-from-other-front-ends%3F) because it has a minimal, [skeuomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph) UI design that prioritizes box art. Check out the screenshots below.

### Total emulation noob?

Nostlan's got your back, with its single-click emulator install feature. It's never been easier to get started with emulation!

### Hardcore collector?

A big bookshelf of game boxes is an impressive conversation starter. Having X amount of games on a hard drive? Not so much. But with Nostlan you can show off your virtual game collection with high quality box assets. It's like a virtual game room!

### Couch gamer?

Nostlan was designed to be used with a game controller, so you won't have to use a mouse and keyboard if you don't want to. Nostlan's UI uses large text only, making it perfect for a big UHD TV or projector.

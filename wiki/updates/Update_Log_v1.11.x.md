Even though I decided to make this project open source and free to use, it still took a lot of work and a long time to develop. If you appreciate my work so far and will continue to use the app please support its development. Thank you!

Features that might be offered in the future:

- support for your PC game libraries! (Origin, Steam, Epic Games, etc.)

I'm going to make a lot of videos about Nostlan which will hopefully make it easier for new users to start using the app. Ideally I would like to have 200+ supporters to consider working on Nostlan a worthwhile investment of my time. If Nostlan got 500+ supporters, I would work on Nostlan full time and come out with updates a lot more frequently. Please support this open source project!

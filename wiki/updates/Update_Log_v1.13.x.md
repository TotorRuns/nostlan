## Update Summary for [v1.13.x](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/releases)

- support for Nintendo Switch Pro controllers
- updated Nintendo Switch database
- async high resolution image loading when game boxes are selected from the library menu
- removed zoom and pan animations when selecting games until I can figure out why some of them make all the games disappear during the transition
- game wiki website "manual" loads when opening a game box now instead of having to press the button to pan over to the manual

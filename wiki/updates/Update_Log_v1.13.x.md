- support for Nintendo Switch Pro controllers
- updated Nintendo Switch database
- async high resolution image loading when game boxes are selected from the library menu
- removed zoom and pan animations when selecting games until I can figure out why some of them make all the games disappear during the transition

Even though I decided to make this project open source and free to use, it still took a lot of work and a long time to develop. If you appreciate my work so far and will continue to use the app please support its development. Thank you!

Features that might be offered in the future:

- support for your PC game libraries! (Origin, Steam, Epic Games, etc.)

For the past two years I've spent way too much time developing Nostlan. I'm really happy with the progress I've made but I'd be able to work on it a lot more if I felt like the community was interested in it. Even 50 supporters would be huge for me! After I get to a point where I feel like I can do a big v2.0 release, I'm going to make a lot of video tutorials that walk people through the setup process. My goal is to have 200 Patreon supporters!

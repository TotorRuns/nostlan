## Update Summary for [v1.14.x](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/releases)

- added Controller Settings Menu
- simplified explanation of [Context Adaptive Button Mapping](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/wiki/Adaptive-Button-Mapping) and why I think people should use it but also by adding the controller settings menu I've made it very easy to disable, adaptive mode will still be the default for new users
- added Game Library Menu

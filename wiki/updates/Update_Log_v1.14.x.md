## Update Summary for [v1.14.x](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/releases)

- added Controller Settings Menu
- simplified explanation of [Context Adaptive Button Mapping](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/wiki/Adaptive-Button-Mapping) and why I think people should use it but also by adding the controller settings menu I've made it very easy to disable, adaptive mode will still be the default for new users
- added Game Library Menu

## Coming Soon

- Nostlan will be able to download and install emulators
- easier way to manually identify games within the app
- easier way to manually download images of game art within the app for games that Nostlan couldn't automatically find art for. This feature would enable users to search for images and add them without even to use their web browser, download them, rename them, and move them to the game's imgdir.
- create an extension protocol that will let users add support other system's game libraries and emulators

Even though I decided to make this project open source and free to use, it still took a lot of work and a long time to develop. If you appreciate my work so far and will continue to use the app please support its development. Thank you!

Features that might be offered in the future:

- support for your PC game libraries! (Origin, Steam, Epic Games, etc.)

For the past two years I've spent way too much time developing Nostlan. I'm really happy with the progress I've made but I'd be able to work on it a lot more if I felt like the community was interested in it. Even 50 supporters would be huge for me! After I get to a point where I feel like I can do a big v2.0 release, I'm going to make a lot of video tutorials that walk people through the setup process. My goal is to have 200 Patreon supporters!

## Update Summary for [v1.15.x](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/releases)

- new automated installer feature is able to install emulator apps within Nostlan. It can handle several types of official build packages: stand alone, portable, installer executables, and dmgs! Just press install and Nostlan will handle downloading, extracting, and moving the emulator app into its default location. On Linux, Nostlan can do package manager cli installs too.

- the new Emulator App Menu appears when you try to play a game with or configure an emulator you don't have or that Nostlan could not find

- improved game library editing options. "add new games" will just look for new games to identify in your game library. "rescan all games" will rescan all game files!
- user preference for launching Nostlan fullscreen or not works now
- on Windows I fixed a bug that could cause games files to be scanned from the same folder twice when doing a game library scan for the first time or full rescan for games

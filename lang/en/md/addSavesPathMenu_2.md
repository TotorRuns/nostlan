# Add Save Sync Folder

This Patreon supporter feature automatically syncs your emulator game saves between this computer and the cloud or a local storage device. Nostlan performs an auto-sync each time you open a game library and performs an auto-backup when you close the app (only for the opened system). WARNING: Use this feature at your own risk if syncing between two computers. When syncing on a second computer for the first time, open the Nostlan menu and click "sync" to get the latest save data from your other computer.

Choose a name for this computer and a backup history amount that specifies the maximum number of backups to keep before older backups are deleted.
When you click "add" a file system prompt will appear, choose the location of your Dropbox, OneDrive, or other folder you want Nostlan to sync to. If you need any help or have any questions about this please send a message on discord.

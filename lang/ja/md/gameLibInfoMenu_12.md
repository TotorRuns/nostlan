# Game Identification

Nostlan can identify most games automatically by scanning your game collection. If it fails to identify a game you'll have to identify it manually. [More info on Nostlan's wiki](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/wiki/Game-Identification)

### Missing Cover Art

Nostlan should be able to get nearly all of your game images. If Nostlan can't find images for a game you can put cover art in the game's image folder. Simply open the game box and click on the game media and you'll see the option `ImgDir` come up on the nav, click this to easily open the game's image folder `emu/{sys}/images/{game id}`. Use these [image names](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/wiki/Image-Names-to-use-for-Game-Art).

## Coming soon

In the future I will implement an easier way to add game art that would allow users to search for images right within Nostlan and add those images without having to use their web browser, download an image, rename it, and move it to the game's image folder.
